        <h2 class="section-title2">PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances)</h2>

        <p class="content-text">
            <span class="bold-text">PFAS</span> are a group of thousands of man-made chemicals with a strong
            carbon-fluorine bond, making them resistant to environmental degradation due to heat, grease, and water.
            They are called <span class="bold-text">"forever chemicals"</span> due to their persistence, and have been
            under use in many common products like nonstick cookware, water-resistant fabrics, hygiene products,
            cosmetics and food packaging, since the 1950s.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            People are exposed through contaminated food, water, and contact with contaminated products. In the
            semiconductor industry, which generates PFAS-laden wastewater, PFAS pose a unique challenge with
            concentrations as high as <span class="bold-text">78,000 ppt</span> in wastewater streams, vastly exceeding
            regulatory limits of <span class="bold-text">4ppt</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            Studies show potential associations between PFAS exposure and various health effects, including altered
            immune and thyroid function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney disease, adverse
            reproductive and developmental outcomes and even <span class="bold-text">cancer</span> - liver, testicular
            and pancreatic.

        <p class="content-text">
            PFAs are found everywhere on Earth, even in Antarctica, and cover everything from air, land, water, plants
            and every living creature including humans, resulting in a massive worldwide contamination. They <span
                class="bold-text">bioaccumulate</span> in the environment and living organisms by binding to proteins in
            the blood, liver, and other tissues, particularly for long-chain molecules. There are approximately <span
                class="bold-text">18,000</span> types of PFAS, making it an extremely large and diverse class of
            chemicals.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            PFAS are not banned or even regulated in India. While India is a party to the Stockholm Convention, which
            includes restrictions on certain PFAS like PFOS, India has not adopted the amendment that would regulate
            PFOS or other PFAS substances according to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN).
        </p>


        <h2 class="section-title2">Microplastics</h2>

        <p class="content-text">
            <span class="bold-text">Microplastics</span> are plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in size,
            originating from primary sources like
            cosmetics or the breakdown of larger plastic items, and are a major environmental and health concern.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            They enter ecosystems through sources like synthetic clothing, plastic products and tire wear and are found
            in diverse environments, including oceans, air, and soil, and are ingested, inhaled or absorbed by humans
            through contaminated food, water, and personal care products.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            MPs originate from various sources, including plastic waste, vehicle tires, synthetic textiles, and
            personal-care products, and have been increasingly detected in human environments (including the food
            chain), water, and air- and even found in the placenta.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            <span class="bold-text">Bioaccumulation</span> of MPs may harm human health, trigger inflammation, and cause
            cellular stress. Evidence is mounting that MPs can have global consequences on the general population by
            possibly inciting inflammatory responses leading to chronic diseases.
            They can interfere with endocrine function, suppress immune responses, and serve as vectors for harmful
            chemicals and pathogens
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            Though the concrete links to certain diseases are still in limbo, it follows that MPs accumulating on and
            within an organism is not good. Reduction in plastic pollution and additional research into toxicity will be
            vital for reducing potential health risks that may not yet be fully understood with regard to its impact on
            human well-being.
