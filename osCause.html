                        In general, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are chemical constituents with oxygen atoms that are
                        highly reactive in the ambient
                        air, can cause respiratory problems and produce adverse health effects in human beings. ROS are
                        generated after the incomplete
                        reduction of molecular oxygen, and are a byproduct of

                        Our skin also emits squalene and fatty acids which react with Ozone
                        (O3) (from outdoor air or electronics). These reactions produce Hydroxyl
                        Radicals (OH), which are the most reactive oxidising agent (FRs) in the
                        atmosphere, and form secondary pollutants like formaldehyde and

                        The Human Oxidation Field is responsible for “Chemical Cleaning”
                        of the air that is close to the surface of our body, under controlled
                        conditions, as the reactive Hydroxyls oxidize pollutants close to the skin,
                        <span class="highlight">
                            However, the same Oxidation Field can create pollutants that

                        offices and airplanes, this effect is amplified, leading to “indoor smog”. Studies have shown
                        that each person carries a 1-2 meter
                        Oxidation Field around them. This field breaks down some pollutants but can also generate new
                        toxic compounds (eg. 4-oxopentanal
