        <div class="description">
            <p>Air pollution in India, both indoors and outdoors, drives oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen
                species (ROS) that damage cells and trigger inflammation.</p>

            <p>The best way to counteract the effects is to have an environment that isolates you from the pollutants,
                is free of all pollutants and provides you with filtered, decontaminated and fresh air. The AIRSHIP is a
                Hyperbaric Air Chamber that is designed to do that.</p>

            <p>However, till the time you do not have an AIRSHIP, here are some steps that you can take to reduce
                Oxidative Stress in your body for better health.</p>

            Consuming foods high in antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C, E, zinc, selenium, and phytochemicals,
            neutralizes ROS induced by pollutants like PM2.5, ozone, and VOCs. Antioxidants donate electrons to free
            radicals, stabilizing them and preventing damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. A 2025 study found that
            Indian children with higher intakes of vitamins A, C, D, zinc, and selenium had lower risks of respiratory

            Adding these affordable foods to daily meals counters oxidative stress. Aim for 2–3 servings of fruits and
            vegetables daily, as recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research.<br><br>

            Indian pickles (achar), a dietary staple, can support or hinder this strategy. Fermented pickles with
            turmeric, garlic, or chili (e.g.,

            homemade mango achar) provide antioxidants and probiotics, reducing inflammation. However, high-salt (5-15%
            sodium), high-

            oil, or sugary pickles (e.g., chhundo) may increase oxidative stress by promoting ROS via vascular stress or
            lipid peroxidation. Limit

            intake to <10 g/day and choose low-salt, low-oil, fermented varieties to maximize benefits. </p>

                <p>In India's high-AQI urban areas (AQI 500–1800), outdoor exercise like walking or running increases
                    PM2.5 inhalation by 2–3x due to deeper breathing, amplifying ROS and oxidative stress.</p>

                <p>For example, Delhi's AQI hit 1800 in 2024, with PM2.5 > 1800 μg/m³, making outdoor activity
                    hazardous. Indoor gyms and yoga studios, often with AQI 200–300, also pose risks due to VOCs or poor
